# School_District_Analysis
##**Overview of Analysis**
The purpose of this analysis was to review each school in the district to find patterns of success and what criteria that success was predicated off of. This was done in an effort to determine where next years school budgeting or resources should be allocated.

There are a few key items we need to address before we proceed with the summary of the analysis. The original analysis had to be refactored after there were questions about the integrity of the Thomas High School ninth grade scores. We will address how we refactored this and what the outcome changes were.

##**Results**
### Impact of Thomas High Updates
Prior to going over the analysis and presenting our findings we will first show a comparison of the original high level summary, and the summary as adjusted with the removal of the Thomas High 9th grade scores.

## Original District Summary

## District Summary post Thomas High adjustment

As you can see between these two outputs the overall summary to the school districts has had little impact after removing the 9th graders from Thomas High.
- Overall Passing dropped from 65% to 64.9%
- Passing Reading went from 86% to 85.7%
- Passing Math went from 75% to 74.8%

So in terms of the overall summary little impact is seen here.

Here we will review changes to the per school summary based on the original ouputs and the adapted output with Thomas 9th removed.

### Original per school summary

### New per school summary

What we can see in this data is that although we see some changes the impact overall is not very large.

-Thomas Highs math passing percentage went from 93.27% to an 93.18%
    -less than a half percent decrease. 
-Thomas Highs reading passing percent decreased from 97.30% to 97.01%
    -again less than a half percent overall change.
-Overall passing percentage went from 90.94% to 90.63%


### How did this impact Thomas High's standing against the other schools?

Overall the impact was minimal. In our review of the top five schools by performance Thomas high was listed as the second best performing school with a 90.94% overall passing rate, once you removed the ninth grade scores they were still rated as number two in performance with a 90.63% overall passing percentage.
